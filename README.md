# Zotero - Obsidian integration
This readme will be filled out soon :)

In the meantime,
## how to use it
feel free to use [zot_guide](zot_guide) as an annotation rulebook for how to highlight and notetake on zotero- i recommend keeping that file open on the right side zotero banner.

use [zot_int.md](zot_int.md) as your template!
